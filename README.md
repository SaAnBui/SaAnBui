ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SaAnBui

ðŸ‘€ After a break to be a stay-at-home mom when we were in France, I am back in Colorado. I'm taking my time to sharpen my skills to land a data role that will work with my skill set and my family. My immediate goal is to get certifiled in Power BI. I am taking courses in DataCamp to prepared me for that. Concurrently, I am going over my Intro to Econometrics textbook. I intend to do the computer excercises using Python. I will post them here. <br>
